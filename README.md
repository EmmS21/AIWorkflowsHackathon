Building an AI Agent to help users study research papers published in Arxiv
## I. Introduction 
<div align="justify">
Our agent generates a random topic and searches for articles in Arxiv based on that topic. It then downloads the article into a PDF file and gives the user a summary of the article, as well as a detailed explanation of the article and some MC Questions to help the user understand the article's topic.
